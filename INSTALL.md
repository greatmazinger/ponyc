# Installing Pony

Prebuilt Pony binaries are available on a number of platforms. They are built using a very generic CPU instruction set and as such, will not provide maximum performance. If you need to get the best performance possible from your Pony program, we strongly recommend [building from source](BUILD.md).

Prebuilt Pony installations will use clang as the default C compiler and clang++ as the default C++ compiler. If you prefer to use different compilers, such as gcc and g++, these defaults can be overridden by setting the `$CC` and `$CXX` environment variables to your compiler of choice.

## FreeBSD 12.1

Prebuilt FreeBSD 12.1 nightly packages are available for download from our [Cloudsmith repository](https://cloudsmith.io/~ponylang/repos/nightlies/packages/?q=name%3A%27%5Eponyc-x86-64-unknown-freebsd-12.1.tar.gz%24%27).

Starting with the next ponyc release, you'll also be able to download prebuilt ponyc releases from Cloudsmith. We'll update this page with the link once they become available.

## Linux

Prebuilt Linux packages are available via [ponyup](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyup) for Glibc and musl libc based Linux distribution. You can install nightly builds as well as official releases using ponyup.

To install the most recent ponyc:

```bash
ponyup update ponyc release
```

Additional requirements:

All ponyc Linux installations need to have a C compiler such as clang installed. Compilers other than clang might work, but clang is the officially supported C compiler. The following distributions have additional requirements:

Distribution | Requires
--- | ---
alpine | libexecinfo
fedora | libatomic

## macOS

Prebuilt macOS packages are available via [ponyup](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyup). You can also install nightly builds using ponyup.

To install the most recent ponyc on macOS:

```bash
ponyup update ponyc release
```

## Windows

Windows users will need to install:

- Visual Studio 2019 or 2017 (available [here](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/)) or the Visual C++ Build Tools 2019 or 2017 (available [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/)).
  - If using Visual Studio, install the `Desktop Development with C++` workload.
  - If using Visual C++ Build Tools, install the `Visual C++ build tools` workload, and the `C++ core features` individual component.
  - Install the latest `Windows 10 SDK (10.x.x.x) for Desktop` component.

Once you have installed the prerequisites, you can download the latest ponyc release from [Cloudsmith](https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/ponylang/releases/raw/versions/latest/ponyc-x86-64-pc-windows-msvc.zip).

Unzip the release file in a convenient location, and you will find `ponyc.exe` in the `bin` directory. Following extraction, to make `ponyc.exe` globally available, add it to your `PATH` either by using Advanced System Settings->Environment Variables to extend `PATH` or by using the `setx` command, e.g. `setx PATH "%PATH%;<directory you unzipped to>\bin"`
